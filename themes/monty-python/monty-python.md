# Monty Python Verb Theme

> "And now for something completely different..."

A collection of absurdist British humor spinner verbs inspired by Monty Python's Flying Circus, Holy Grail, and Life of Brian. Each verb transforms iconic moments into present participles that read naturally with timing (e.g., "Ni-ing for 30s").
