# Trump Mockery Theme

> "I have the best words. I have the best, but there is no better word than stupid."
> — Donald J. Trump, being the very best at words

## About This Theme

This is **complete satire and mockery** of Donald Trump's verbal tics, lies, incompetence, ego, and general absurdity. Every verb is a roast of something ridiculous he actually said, did, or represents. This is meant to be hilarious, not political commentary. Okay, it's also political commentary. Believe me.

These spinners are tremendous. Many people are saying they're the best spinners. Nobody has ever seen spinners like this before. Huge. Bigly.
