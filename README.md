## Creating New Themes

This repo includes a Claude Code skill for generating new themes. Copy `skills/verb-theme-creator/SKILL.md` to your `~/.claude/skills/` directory, then ask Claude to create a new verb theme.

The skill guides you through:
- Brainstorming verbs around your theme
- Converting quotes/references into action verb format
- Generating the required file structure

## Contributing

Got a theme idea? PRs welcome! Each theme needs:

```
themes/your-theme/
├── README.md           # Quick intro + sample verbs
├── your-theme.md       # Full verb list with references table
└── your-theme.json     # Raw JSON config
```

Aim for 30-45 verbs. Make them action verbs that work grammatically (present participles that read naturally with "for 30s" after them).
